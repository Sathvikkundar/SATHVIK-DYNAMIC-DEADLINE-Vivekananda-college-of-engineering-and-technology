This project integrates Flask and the Asana API to manage task events via webhooks. I worked on automating task updates, priority changes, and due date adjustments in an Asana project. To achieve this, I used create_webhook.py for registering webhooks and app.py to listen for events. Tasks in the "In Progress" section were monitored for actions like priority changes and section movements, and I set up automated responses to handle these.

While working on this project, I faced several errors. When the webhook registration failed, I discovered that the ASANA_PROJECT_ID in my environment variables was incorrect, and I fixed it by validating them properly. The handshake initially failed because I didnâ€™t handle the X-Hook-Secret correctly, but I resolved this by returning it with the appropriate headers. JSON parsing errors also gave me trouble, so I added error handling for malformed payloads. I had to debug priority mappings because my custom field IDs were wrong, and testing with the Asana API helped me get them right. Another issue was tasks not moving between sections due to mismatched section IDs, which I identified and corrected through API testing. Finally, I encountered timeouts in Asana API requests, and I resolved this by adding retry logic and increasing request timeouts. These errors taught me the importance of testing and debugging at every step.
